# spaces_to_csv
A very simple utility to turn a file with any kind of words separated by spaces to a CSV file (comma separated values).
I'm not above giving credit, I got the regex idea from this Stack Overflow post, and used it. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26949752/re-sub-replace-spaces-with-comma

I just thought it would help people to have this basic level of utility easily available. Thanks to those that came before me and made this information public knowledge.
